These Privacy Policy (i) apply to Ludenio Labs’s online games and related services (the "Services"), and (ii) govern the relationship between you and Ludenio Labs. If you are using our Services through a social network, platform or applications provider (“Third Party Service”) (e.g., Facebook, Steam, iTunes, Google Play, etc.), any activities provided by such third party beyond Ludenio Labs’s Services are governed by that Third Party Service’s policies. If at any point you do not agree to any portion of the then-current version of our Terms of Service or another policies of Ludenio Labs, you must cease using the Services and your license to use the Services shall terminate.</p>

    <h3>AGREEMENT TO PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
    <p>By accessing any of Ludenio Labs’s Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy (and any updates thereto). By so agreeing, you authorize us to collect and use your information as outlined below. In the event you do not agree with this Privacy Policy (and any amendments which may be adopted by us), your only recourse is to cease use of our Services.</p>
    <p>Please be aware that if you are using our Services through a social network, platform or applications provider (“Third Party Service”) (e.g., Facebook, Steam, iTunes, Google Play, etc.), any activities provided by such third party beyond Ludenio Labs’s Services are governed by that Third Party Service’s policies. We consider it a best practice for you to review the privacy policy of each website you frequent (as well as the privacy policies of any partners we may work with including advertisers) in order to be an informed consumer and to fully understand how your Personal Data is being handled.</p>

    <h3>PERSONAL DATA DEFINED</h3>
    <p>"Personal Data" is information that identifies you or that can be used to contact you (online or offline). Personal Data can include your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, gender, birthdate, etc.</p>

    <h3>COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA AND PURPOSES</h3>
    <p>We collect Personal Data in a variety of ways in order to provide you with the best possible experience using our Services. Sources of information include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Information You Provide To Us:</strong> You may choose to voluntarily provide us with information by registering or communicating with Ludenio Labs. If you communicate with us, we will collect and record the information you have shared with us so that we can provide you with the Services or address your inquiry. During the registration process, we do collect basic information about you including your name and email address.</li>
        <li><strong>Third Party Platforms and Social Networks:</strong> When you participate in our Services which are provided through a Third Party Service, we may obtain information about you from that service such as your name, gender, geographic area and affiliations. For example, we may use your location in association with your user name to display your game score on a top player scoreboard. Your gender designation derived from a Third Party Service may also be shown but your gender will never limit you on the levels that you can achieve while playing the game (which in the free-to-play context reflects skill, not gender) and/or to a specific gameplay style or type of character. As a developer of an application which is provided through a Third Party Service, Ludenio Labs is required to follow the governing policies of such Third Party Service (including the handling of Personal Data).</li>
        <li><strong>IP Addresses:</strong> We do monitor and store information about the IP addresses from which you access our Services. In general, these log files are used to monitor traffic on our Services, to troubleshoot technical problems and to collect aggregate information (e.g., to monitor and analyze demographic and preference information among our users). We may block certain IP addresses to comply with specific license agreements and/or in the event we detect user abuse of our Services. IP addresses could also be used to personally identify you in order to enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
        <li><strong>Geolocation:</strong> Geolocation refers to the identification of the geographic location of a user or computing device via a variety of data collection mechanisms. Geolocation services use various means to ascertain location including network routing addresses, internal GPS devices and/or the newer W3C Geolocation standard. Our site may use various of these standards depending upon the platform and device that you are using to play our games.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> Ludenio Labs utilizes cookies in connection with the operation of its Services. If you have registered to use our Services and/or play our games, your consent during the registration process means you have agreed to our use of cookies in accordance with applicable law and this Privacy Policy. Cookies are used on our site to facilitate user sign-on, and to retain user preferences and other information. Third party service providers may use cookies to track whether you have clicked on an advertisement and registered to play our games. A “cookie” is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Although your browser may be pre-set to accept cookies, you can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. Please note, however, that some parts of our Services will not function properly if you disable cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Other Data Collection Mechanisms:</strong> We may employ technologies including (i) clear Graphics Interchange Formats (“GIFs”) (i.e., web bugs, beacons or tags), which allow us to know if a certain page was visited or whether an e-mail was opened; (ii) tracking pixels, which allow us to advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages or identifying the source of a new installation or registration; and (iii) local shared objects also known as flash cookies, which help us to prevent fraud, remember your progress on certain in-game tasks and in-game settings. Clear GIFs are not used to collect Personal Data about you. However, we may use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page.</li>
    </ul>

        <li><strong>Game Play Information:</strong> We may collect and retain information relating to your interaction with our Services. For example, we may monitor the number and type of activities you participate in during a particular session, your scores and the length of time you spend on our Services.</li>
