            <h3>UGC</h3>
            <p>In all cases, you agree that such UGC is wholly original to you and you exclusively own the rights to such UGC, including the right to grant all of the rights and licenses in such UGC to Ludenio Labs without Ludenio Labs incurring any third party obligations or liability arising out of its exercise of the rights granted herein by you. You further grant to Ludenio Labs a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicenseable, and transferable license (i) to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, perform and otherwise exploit in any manner whatsoever the UGC, or any portion thereof, on our Games as well as via any and all media now known or hereafter developed, and (ii) to advertise, market and promote the same. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, you hereby assign and/or waive any moral rights or rights of publicity or privacy you may have in such UGC, where it is applicable under the actual law. Further, you bear the entire risk of the completeness, accuracy and/or quality of your UGC found in the Games.

        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>VIRTUAL CURRENCY AND VIRTUAL GOODS; REFUND POLICIES</h3>
            <p>Virtual Currency is a suppositive unit displayed in our Games, which determines the scope of your rights to use Virtual Goods. You may use the Virtual Currency exclusively within the gameplay of our Games without any our responsibility for such use. Virtual Currency is not an object of any applicable legislation on betting, lottery, gambling and currency operations. Virtual Currency is used for convenient and clear understanding of your volume of acquired rights to Virtual Goods. Thus, amount of Virtual Currency depends on the amount of payment according to the rate established by in-game rules and published within the framework of the game process. According to the meaning of these Terms and to any offer related to it, amount of Virtual Currency depends (and consequently determines) on the amount of payment that you made due to the acceptance of the offer on Virtual Currency/ Virtual Goods.</p>
            <p>Virtual Goods is an additional interactive in-game content that effects to and interacts with our Games, which actually is a part of gameplay (like additional, expanded, special features, processes or possibilities within the gameplay, such as the abilities of the game character, privileges, special game items, maps, quests, and of similar nature), license rights on which are not presented and granted to you unless you made an additional “real money” payment or express another kind of acceptance in the ways provided in the in- game rules.</p>
            <p>Therefore, our Games may include Virtual Currency, such as coins, cash, or points that may be purchased for “real” money through transactions with one of our authorized payment vendors. In turn, Virtual Currency may be used to purchase Virtual Goods. Ludenio Labs does not handle Virtual Currency transactions directly. Third party payment providers handle all Virtual Currency transactions. By purchasing Virtual Currency to be used in our Games, you are bound by these third party payment providers’ terms of use.</p>
            <p>Ludenio Labs prohibits and does not recognize any purported transfers of virtual property effectuated outside of our Games, or the purported sale, gift or trade in the "real world" of anything that appears or originates in our Games, unless otherwise expressly authorized by Ludenio Labs in writing. You are therefore not permitted to trade, sell or attempt to sell in-game items or currency for "real" money, or exchange those items or currency for value of any kind outside of a game, without Ludenio Labs’s written permission. Any such transfer or attempted transfer is prohibited and void, and will subject your account to termination.</p>
            <p><strong>Payment for Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods.</strong> Your order of Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods will represent an offer to us to purchase such items, which will be accepted by us when we assign make the relevant Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods available in your account for you to use on our Games or debit your banking account or card, whichever comes first. We may revise the pricing for Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods offered through our Games at any time.</p>
            <p><strong>Virtual Currency Offered by Third Parties.</strong> Please be aware that if you purchase Facebook Credits, Google Play Credit, or make a purchase via Steam or other payment credit offered by the applicable Third Party Service, you are agreeing to that service’s payment terms and Ludenio Labs is not a party to the transaction. You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using an account registered to you. You will also be subject to that Third Party Service’s refund policies.</p>
            <p><strong>Games Offered through Steam.</strong> We offer a generous refund policy to our users. You may request a refund of a game for any reason (i) within fourteen (14) days of purchase and (ii) so long as the game has been played for less than two hours and the downloadable content has not been consumed, modified or transferred.</p>
            <p><strong>European Union rules.</strong> If you reside in the European Union, by law you have the right to withdraw from a purchase within fourteen (14) days, commencing on the day when you receive your purchase (“cooling-off period”) if you have not used the Virtual Currency, Virtual Goods and/or game within the cooling-off period and you wish to obtain a refund, please immediately advise Ludenio Labs (or the applicable Third Party Service) so that a refund can be issued within 30 days. If your use of our Games or game purchase is subject to any type of use or sales tax, then Ludenio Labs may also charge you for those taxes.</p>
            <p><strong>Illegal charges.</strong> If a user has incurred charges or fees as a result of bona fide identity theft, Ludenio Labs will work with the user and the third party payment provider to achieve a refund for such charges or fees.</p>
            <p><strong>License to Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods.</strong> Other than a limited, revocable, non- transferable license to use the Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods in our Games, you have no right in or title to such Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods. Ludenio Labs has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify, and/or eliminate Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods as it sees fit in its sole discretion, and Ludenio Labs shall have no liability to you or anyone for the exercise of such rights.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES; ADVERTISEMENTS</h3>
            <p>Ludenio Labs may provide links on our Games to third party websites or vendors who may invite you to participate in a promotional offer in return for receiving additional services, Virtual Goods and/or Virtual Currency. Any charges or obligations you incur in your dealings with these third parties are your responsibility. Ludenio Labs makes no representation or warranty regarding any content, goods and/or services provided by any third party (even if linked from our Games), and will not be liable for any claim relating to any third party content, goods and/or services. Ludenio Labs is not responsible for such third party content, business practices or privacy policies, or for the collection, use or disclosure of any information those sites may collect.</p>

If you have a dispute with one or more users, you release us (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.</p>
        </li>

            <h3>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h3>
            <p>Before resorting to formal dispute resolution mechanisms, we strongly encourage you to first contact us directly to seek a resolution within a thirty (30) day period. If this fails, additional informal discussions begin upon written notice from you or Ludenio Labs. Ludenio Labs will send its notice to the email address you have provided to us and may also provide a copy to a physical address if we have one on file. You will send your notice to Ludenio Labs at: <a href="mailto:legal@luden.io">legal@luden.io</a>. This Section shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. If the laws of your jurisdiction prohibit the application of some or all of the provisions of this Section, such provisions will not apply to you.</p>
            <p><strong>Exceptions to Informal discussions and arbitration.</strong> You and Ludenio Labs agree that the following disputes are not subject to the provisions concerning informal discussions and binding arbitration: (1) any disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any intellectual property rights; (2) any dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or criminal activity; and (3) any claim for injunctive relief.</p>
            <p><strong>Arbitration.</strong> If it is not possible to resolve a dispute through informal discussions, either you or Ludenio Labs may elect to have the dispute (except those disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by final binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be performed under the arbitration rules of the Cyprus Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by these rules.</p>
            <p><strong>Venue.</strong> Any arbitration will take place in the Republic of Cyprus. Either party may appear via digital or telephonic means if a personal appearance is not reasonably feasible. Further, you and Ludenio Labs agree that the following rules shall apply to the arbitration proceedings: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted in English or in a language mutually agreed by the parties; (b) the arbitration shall take place in a timely manner; (c) discovery shall be limited and pre-hearing information exchange shall be limited to the reasonable production of relevant documents; (d) the arbitration award shall be rendered within six (6) months of the commencement of the arbitration, unless such time limit is extended by the arbitrator; and (e) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

            <h3>GENERAL PROVISIONS</h3>
            <p><strong>Assignment.</strong> Ludenio Labs may assign or delegate these Terms and/or the Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent. You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under the Terms or Privacy Policy without Ludenio Labs’s prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment and delegation by you is ineffective.</p>
            <p><strong>Severability.</strong> You and Ludenio Labs agree that if any portion of these Terms or of the Privacy Policy is found illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part by any court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective solely to the extent of such determination of invalidity or unenforceability without affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other manner or jurisdiction and without affecting the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall continue to be in full force and effect.</p>
            <p><strong>Supplemental Policies.</strong> Ludenio Labs may publish additional policies related to specific services such as forums, promotions, contests or loyalty programs.

            <p><strong>Equitable Remedies Available to Ludenio Labs.</strong> You acknowledge that the rights granted and obligations made under these Terms are of a unique and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which shall irreparably harm Ludenio Labs and which cannot be replaced by monetary damages alone so that Ludenio Labs shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief (without the obligations of posting any surety or proof of damages) in the event of any breach or anticipatory breach by you.</p>
            <p><strong>Your Waiver of Injunctive or Equitable Relief.</strong> You irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive or other equitable relief, or to enjoin or restrain the operation of our Games, exploitation of any advertising or other materials issued in connection therewith, or exploitation of our Games or any content or other material used or displayed through our Games and agree to limit your claims to claims for monetary damages (if any), in accordance with the limitations stated herein.</p>
            <p><strong>Survival of Provisions.</strong> Sections and provisions which by their nature survive expiration or termination of these Terms, including without limitation liability and warranty disclaimers and limitations, shall survive expiration or termination.</p>
            <p><strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> These Terms, any other policies and any documents expressly incorporated by reference herein (including the Privacy Policy and Code of Conduct), contain the entire understanding of you and Ludenio Labs, and supersede all prior understandings of the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof, whether electronic, oral or written, or whether established by custom, practice, policy or precedent, between you and us with respect to our Games. Except as expressly and specifically set forth in this these Terms, no representations, statements, consents, waivers, or other acts or omissions by Ludenio Labs shall be deemed a modification of these Terms nor legally binding, unless documented in physical writing, hand signed by you and a duly appointed officer of Ludenio Labs.</p>
